speech analysis pipeline project

Please ignore the mess - this is going to be scrappy!

## Introduction:
- This is the GitHub page for the speech-analysis project
- The notes folder is just for keeping our thinking on how each thing works/things we try/tech et al
- The lit folder holds papers and notes on those papers for anything relevant. This will evolve to include subfolders for each topic.
- I have put together a mural for ideas/pipeline discussion
