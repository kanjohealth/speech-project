In particular hypokinetic dysarthria (marked by a reduction of loudness and articulation amplitude). Slow speech -> fast rush.
90% PD patients have dysarthria - median latency 7 years.
dysphonia (65.5%) articulatory impairment (38.5%)

Four main groups of study: phonatory, articulatory, prosodic, cofnitive-linguistic.


They discarded works analysing the prosodic or linguistic aspets exclusively. (also those that include pharmacological intervention - this could be relevant if currently under treatment)

The review inlcludes a list of the acoustic features that were identified - along with some representative studies using them and a visualisation of their discriminant properties in the Neurovoz corpus [27]
