In particular hypokinetic dysarthria (marked by a reduction of loudness and
articulation amplitude). Slow speech -> fast rush.
90% PD patients have dysarthria - median latency 7 years.
dysphonia (65.5%) articulatory impairment (38.5%)

Four main groups of study: phonatory, articulatory, prosodic, cofnitive-linguistic.


They discarded works analysing the prosodic or linguistic aspets exclusively.
(also those that include pharmacological intervention - this could be relevant
if currently under treatment)

The review inlcludes a list of the acoustic features that were
identified - along with some representative studies using them and a
visualisation of their discriminant properties in the Neurovoz corpus [27]

Phonatory - usually from a sustained vowel

acoustic meaasures can be directly obtained using available software and
libraries such ass Muultidimensional Voice Program (MDVP), Praat or OpenSMILE.

HNR and NHR are popular (and jitter and shimmer)

There is a list of other features and potentially interesting things to

another subsequent study employing a corpus with age-matched groups
[32], the authors report higher fundamental frequency and fundamental
frequency variability in patients (20 participants) than in controls (20
participants) and low correlation between this feature and symptom

segment duration and

This is
contradictory with the findings exposed in [13,81–84] where a strong
influence of the disease is found in certain consonants.

The reason is that hypokinetic dysarthria can be
considered a multidimensional impairment [22] and its manifestations
may depend on the individual and PD sub-type (postural instability/gait
difficulty and tremor-dominant phenotypes, for instance) [92].


For instance, the study [93] analyzes segment duration and speech error
rates in 15 patients with neurological disorders (8 of them with PD) and
15 controls during the production of syllable sequences, ranging from
low to high complexity. T

esults suggest that
patients present significantly longer vowel duration


articles in the literature measure the speech formants and
their evolution to assess PD. Some of these approaches employ VSA-
related features, that are calculated using the formants from vowels
extracted from connected speech [101–105] instead of using sustained
vowels as a acoustic material.



**The argument for monologues:**
For instance, [104] presents a comparison of PD detection techniques
using only vowel segments extracted from sustained vowels, sentence
repetitions, reading passages, and monologues of 20 untreated patients
and 15 male control speakers. Significant differences between the two
groups are obtained for tVSA and Vowel Articulation Index (VAI) fea-
tures, which are lower in patients than in controls. Compared to other
studies that use only sustained vowels, as [42], this study reports a more
significant separability between groups when using vowels from
monologues.
