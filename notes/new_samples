# actual lines to run in terminal have '>' before them
# samples should download with repo - but if not, can extract yourself with the following instructions

in terminal in venv run the following to install youtube-dl:

> sudo -H pip install --upgrade youtube-dl

(also possible to use homebrew etc depending on machine, see extensive and good docs: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)

The current playlist of short samples made by my YT account is here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcwHfmFRqOI&list=PLS3sORxAFBAJM1He0gXkOOCDOXsqFFskC

run this in terminal in the raw_samples directory:

> youtube-dl -x --audio-format wav --audio-quality 0 --output "%(upload_date)s"_"%(id)s.%(ext)s" -i PLS3sORxAFBAJM1He0gXkOOCDOXsqFFskC

(translated: format wav, location here, highest audio quality, output name is UPLOADDATE_VIDEOID, playlist ID. - UPLOADDATE is in format YYYYMMDD)
